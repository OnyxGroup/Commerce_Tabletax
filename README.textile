h1. Commerce Tabletax

For use in Drupal Commerce. Adds a tax rate based on the current shipping address zip code for the order. The tax rate comes from the database table "tax_rate". Requires the Commerce Shipping Module.

h2. Instructions

h3. Install the database

You will have to manually install the database, I provide a sample schema although you really only need the fields for zip code and tax rate. I also included the sample data for the Georgia Tax rates.

h3. Install the module

Upload the module to your modules directory and enable it. You will also need to install the Commerce Shipping module so that we have access to the "postal code" field.

h2. Props

Just want to give shoutouts to all the great devs who put out code that I am using here:
All the guys at Drupal Commerce for continually putting out great products and answering community questions.
